javac - java compiler
-d - option, we use along with javac command
../

comments in java
-----------------
1. comments are used for information purpose.
2. by using comments we can mention what that specific line of code is doing. 
3. comments will ignored by the compiler. 
4. commented statements will be not part of the compilation.
5. comments are also used for documentation purpose as well.
6. There are three types of comments in java
   1. single-line comment `//`
   2. multi-line comments `/*   contents

                                     */`
   multi-line comment will be used to comment a block of   code. ex: to comment an entire method

   3. documentation comment 
   `/*
    *
    *
    *
    *
    */`
    To document the source code, we can use the documentation comment.

Note: semicolon `;` indicates the end of the statement.

white-space in java(space-bar character)
-------------------
- white spaces will be ignored by the java compiler
- white space can be used for better readability purpose.
- the entire program can be written in a single line, but it will be difficult to understand by the new developers.
- To avoid the confusions we can use as many white spaces required.
- we can use the white-spaces in the form of indentation.

Note: indentation is nothing but the required white-spaces according to the coding stadards for better readability.

Errors and Warnings
--------------------
- Errors and Warning in java are the red-flags.
- In case of Error its a serious one
  Ex: syntax errors 
- Warning is not serious but it should considered.
- If we try to write the code which not usual and it may cause some issue, in those cases compiler will throw warning.
